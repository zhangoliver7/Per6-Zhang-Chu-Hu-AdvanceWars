Goals for week starting June 2

Aight, I don't know if you guys finished the error on Field yet. If not, I guess I'll take a look into it.
Hopefully we've all downloaded Processing by now.
I've started familiarizing myself with the interface over the weekend, although I've failed to find any text based tutorials.

In any case, this week, we should begin to try to figure out how to put the classes together
We also need to figure out how to integrate these elements into a processing setting.

Best of luck,
