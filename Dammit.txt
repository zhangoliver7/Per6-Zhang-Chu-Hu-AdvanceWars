Man, we're so tight right now, goofed hard :/

Things we need to do to not get screwed over Monday:

-We need to be able to display a grid of terrain.
-We need to be able to read a text file and generate variable terrain based on the text file.
-We need units to be able to attack enemy units, move, and capture buildings
-With that said, we need buildings to be capturable
-We are going to need a way to interact with the processing interface.
Because drop-down menus are difficult, I will propose an interface based on mouse clicks at school.
In drawing. Cause it's impossible to explain here.

Slightly less important stuff (Well, actually, easier stuff):

-We actually need different terrain and units.
-We need a damage formula and how it reflects HP.
-We should have some way to adjust the settings of the game.

Cool stuff we can do if we actually finish this before due date:

-CO powers
-Weather
-Use of Sprites
